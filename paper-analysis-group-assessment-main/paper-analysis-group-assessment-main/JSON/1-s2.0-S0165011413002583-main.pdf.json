The first procedure corresponds to the methodology proposed in this paper, which uses fuzzy sets associated to linguistic variables and a prioritized hierarchical aggregation process, while the second procedure is based on the additive methodology applied by Ramey [37] to construct the High-Risk Index, a measure used to distin-guish children by origin-family economic status and exposition level to multiple risks. High-Risk Index considers 13 child's home risk factors, measured from variables related to the child's family socio-educational and economic level, where each of these variables have an associated weight representing its contribution to the child's home risk indicator."}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 0, "right": 20, "firstLine": 198}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "K.

As an example, consider the aggregation of different variables involved in the construction of an index, with different roles or importance. In this work, the initial notion of consistency presented in [38] has been translated to the context of prioritized structured data, distinguishing between linear orders and hierarchical structures. Prioritized aggregation operators based on linear orders or hierarchical structures are more adequate for those aggregation processes in which trade-offs between the different elements are not acceptable.

The information involved in the development of these indexes has been represented by means of fuzzy sets, where the membership functions were defined by experts' judgments, just as the prioritization relationships between the variables. Social indexes developed in this work have been generated by means of a consistent family of prioritized aggregation operators.

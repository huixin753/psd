This system relies on a noisy repre-sentation of number magnitudes, hence obeying the Weber-Fechner law according to which the sensitivity to a difference in stimulus intensity is proportional to the magnitude of that stimulus. One key signature of the ANS is the observation of scalar variability when participants have to estimate numbers of elements without counting. In such numerical tasks, the estimates and the variability in the estimates increase linearly as a function of the numerosity, leading to a constant coefficient of variation (Brannon, 2006; Opfer & Siegler, 2012; Whalen, Gallistel, & Gelman, 1999)."}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 0, "right": 22, "firstLine": 238}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "Another key signature of the ANS is the observation of ratio-dependent effects in tasks requiring comparing or detecting numerical differences between numerosities represented by visual elements, sounds, or actions.

Further, ratio-effects change over the lifespan. In preferential looking para-digms with 2-day-olds, looking time was greater when viewing congruent associations between sounds and visual objects (e.g., 12 syllables and 12 objects) than incongruent associations (e.g., 12 syllables and 4 objects, i.e. with a 1:3 ratio), suggesting that newborns have an abstract representation of number (Izard, Sann, Spelke, & Streri, 2009).

The idea is that the child ascertains the meaning of \"two\" from the interplay between the acquisition of natural language quan-tifiers and the visual attention system of parallel object individuation. By contrast, the child comes to know the meaning of larger number words such as \"five\" through a bootstrapping process - i.e., that \"five\" means \"one more than four, which is one more than three\u2026\" - by integrating represen-tations of natural language quantifiers with the external serial ordered count list. Through the mastery of the successor function by a multiple-stage process (Sarnecka & Carey, 2008), the child under-stands how verbal numerals represent the natural numbers.

In particular, it is important to examine whether this property appears before or after children figure out the cardi-nal value represented by each number word. The rationale is the following: if the ANS plays a role in the acquisition of number words, verbal estimates should increase with numerosities but they should also become more variable, hence resulting in a constant coefficient of variation.

For in-stance, deciding that the physical size of 8 is larger than that of 5 is easier than deciding that the physical size of 5 is larger than that of 8 (see Fig. 1B), suggesting that the task-irrelevant numerical informa-tion is activated and interferes with the task-relevant physical information. The so-called size congruity effect has been consistently observed in adults (e.g., Tzelgov, Meyer, & Henik, 1992) but also in chil-dren from the age of 7-8 (Girelli et al., 2000; Rubinsten, Henik, Berger, & Shahar-Shalev, 2002), that is, about 1-2 years later than the age at which they are able to compare the magnitude of these digits explicitly. In such interference paradigms, results are more mixed regarding the presence or not of the numerical distance effect. While some authors found no impact of numerical distance when chil-dren had to judge the physical size of two Arabic numbers (Rubinsten et al., 2002), others demonstrated the presence of a reverse distance effect with faster response times for pairs of small distances rela-tive to pairs of large distances (Girelli et al., 2000). Compatible with this, another study reported a modulation of the size congruity effect by the numerical distance, with the observation of a numer-ical interference effect in physical judgment only when the Arabic numbers were separated by a large numerical ratio (Mussolin & No\u00ebl, 2007). This suggests that the approximate number representa-tions are evoked automatically and that they interfere with the physical information at least when the magnitude number information is sufficiently salient.

In a series of experiments, Nieder and his colleagues (for a review, see Nieder, 2005) found neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex and in the fundus of the intraparietal sulcus whose activity peaked when a particular numerosity was pre-sented and decreased as a function of distance from the preferred number. Moreover, when monkeys were trained to associate visual shapes with varying numbers of items, neurons showed a distance effect for"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 0, "right": 20, "firstLine": 238}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "12 "}, {"TYPE": "TabChar"}, {"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "C.

More support is provided by the inves-tigation of performance in nonsymbolic number tasks in populations that did not receive math education. In particular, two Brazilian tribes have been studied for their limited numerical system. Pirah\u00e3 have an impoverished verbal counting system with only a few words roughly corresponding to the concepts of\"one,\" \"two,\" and \"many.\" When they were presented with numerical matching tasks, members of the Pirah\u00e3 tribe had relatively good accuracy with two or three items, but they responded poorly with quan-tities between 3 and 10. Beyond a set of three items, the variation of their estimates increases with the set size, resulting in a constant coefficient of variation (Gordon, 2004). Pirah\u00e3's performance in these tasks is thus comparable with estimates of preschool \"mappers\" of Le Corre and Carey's study (Le Corre & Carey, 2007). Number processing has also been assessed in the Munduruk\u00f9, an Amazonian indigene culture with little access to education (Pica et al., 2004). Although the Munduruk\u00f9 lack words for numbers beyond 5, they are able to compare and add large approximate numbers far beyond their naming range. When asked to compare sets of 20-80 dots, controlled for various non-numerical variables, their performances were far above chance level and decreased with the ratio between quantities as French controls. However, whereas French adults' Weber fraction is around .12, Amazonian adults' average Weber fraction was .17, suggest-ing that the symbolic system allows humans to reach a finer ANS acuity."}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 0, "right": 20, "firstLine": 238}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "Another line of research focused on participants with low literacy.

(2013) reported that Western adults who had received no formal instruction in mathematics displayed longer response times, higher error rates, and a smaller numerical ratio effect in numerosity comparison than Western adults who benefited from math education.

Some previous findings could be reinterpreted in the light of this hypothesis. In the number-line estimation tasks de-scribed previously, children who initially produce logarithm-based estimations provided estimates that followed a linear function just after receiving one trial of feedback on their estimates (Opfer & Siegler, 2007; Opfer & Thompson, 2008). This change could be seen as an effect of the calibration provided by the sym-bolic number. However, one cannot exclude the possibility of a change of strategy in the way children perform the task. To the best of our knowledge, the only direct data favouring a symbolic-to-ANS influence in chil-dren are gathered by our research group (Mussolin, Nys, Content, & Leybaert, 2014). We measured both symbolic and nonsymbolic number skills in children of 3-4 years within a 7-month interval. At each as-sessment, preschoolers' precision in comparing numerosities as well as their level of knowledge of number words and Arabic digits was measured. Comparing relationships between symbolic and nonsymbolic mea-sures across the two time points allowed us to examine the predictive direction of the link. Importantly, both cardinality proficiency and symbolic number knowledge predicted later accuracy in numerosity com-parison whereas the reverse links were not significant. These findings demonstrate for the first time that learning of symbolic numbers improves the precision of ANS. In this longitudinal study, we demon-strated that children of 3-4 years who started with a high level of cardinality proficiency and of knowledge about symbolic numbers were more accurate in a numerosity comparison task 7 months later than pre-schoolers who started with poorer symbolic number abilities.

While games with an environmental focus date back little more than 30 years (Eisenack & Reckien, 2013) they have recently stirred interest among sustainability researchers and educators - albeit primarily in the form of digital games such as fatE Of tHE WORLD (Roberts, 2011) and ECO (Krajewski, 2018). Despite being over-shadowed by their digital counterparts in terms of popularity in contemporary research, environmental board games cover a variety of topics. Some, like tHE CELSIuS GaME (Carreira et al., 2017) attempt to visualize climate change issues on a holistic level to illustrate their interconnected complexities. Others focus more on specific aspects of climate change, such as the water resource adaptation game WatER aRK (Cheng et al., 2019) and tHE faRMERS (fennewald & Kievit-Kylar, 2013), which revolves around the use of shared resources. Such board games, much like certain forms of art (Ramachandran, 2011, p. 197), have the ability to distort and exaggerate reality and generate meaningful experiences for their audience. they also allow play-ers to experiment with a variety of roles in a coherent narrative (arnaudo, 2018, p. 27) within the safe confines of the game world (Garc\u00eda-Barros et al., 2015). this is found to be a trigger for attitude change in certain settings (Elms, 1966) as well as allowing for exploring opposing perspectives (Kl\u00f6ckner, 2015, p. 206). furthermore, games can create microworlds (Egenfeldt-nielsen et al., 2013, p. 237) where the players learn through \"doing\" and \"being\" rather than passively absorbing information, as well as allowing for the envisioning and portrayal of alternate futures and realities (Barreteau et al., 2007; Cushman-Roisin et al., 2000; Wu & Lee, 2015). In a more traditional classroom setting, the learner will usually passively absorb information from a knowl-edgeable source and be expected to remember and understand the instructions they are provided (Dieleman & Huisingh, 2006; Krathwohl, 2002, p. 214). practical applica-tion of the obtained knowledge is often not prioritized (Kolb, 1984). By contrast, as previously mentioned, game-based learning normally situates the learner in a micro-world where they can actively participate and interact with their environment (Egenfeldt-nielsen et al., 2013, p. 237). Games also provide a concrete visualization of the topic at hand, rather than forcing the learner to form a subjective, abstract con-ceptualization of it - meaning that they \"learn through doing and being\" (foltz et al., 2019), an experience-based learning approach (Rusca et al., 2012). Games can also engross and immerse the players by providing rich and immersive narratives, which in turn might affect real-world beliefs by making the gaming experience seem real (Green & Brock, 2000). Research also shows that having someone experience fic-tional stories about social dilemmas - i.e., a game's narrative - might influence their real-world judgments on them (Strange & Leung, 1999). this illustrates the difference between indirect (classroom) and direct (game or simulation) experience, where direct"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 0, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "table", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "table-row", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "table-cell", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "636"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 2, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}]}, {"TYPE": "table-cell", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "Simulation & Gaming 51(5)"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 0, "right": 2, "firstLine": 0}}}]}]}]}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "experiences are demonstrably more effective in generating pro-environmental action (fazio & Zanna, 1981; Kollmuss & agyeman, 2002)."}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 2, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "Board Games as Social Dilemma Simulations"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 2, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "until recently, researchers assumed that people did not possess sufficient knowledge about environmental problems and therefore also lacked the tools to circumvent them - thus making knowledge provision a viable strategy for behavioral change (Schultz, 2002). although games are effective at increasing knowledge, this alone is seldom enough to initiate pro-environmental behavior (abrahamse et al., 2007; frick et al., 2004; Hines et al., 1987; Kollmuss & agyeman, 2002; Staats et al., 1996). this is compounded by the finding that knowledge gained through traditional forms of learn-ing, especially in situations where the motivation to learn stems from a fear of failure (for example, studying for a test) also tends to be retained very rarely (Grolnick & Ryan, 1987; Lombardi, 2012). While a large quantity of available games are primarily aimed at providing knowledge, some are also designed to situate the players in social dilemmas - situations where the interests of the individual are in conflict with the interests of a group or collective (von Borgstede et al., 2013, p. 176). In a game-based social dilemma, players are often forced to consider whether they wish to prioritize their own gain and safety, or if they would rather act in the best interest of the player group as a whole. the use of games to study human behavior in social dilemma situa-tions has been conducted before, the most prominent example being an examination of how WORLD Of WaRCRaft players responded to a virtual plague that would wipe out entire servers (Lofgren & fefferman, 2007). the extent to which individuals care about their own and others' gains in a dilemma situation is known as their social value orientation, or SVO (Messick & McClintock, 1968), and can roughly be divided into an individualistic approach where a player tries to act alone with little to no communi-cation with the group, a cooperative approach where the player tries to establish active partnerships with other players and a competitive approach where the player's empha-sis is on defeating the other players (de Groot & th\u00f8gersen, 2013, p. 143). Compared to games focusing on collaboration, games in which the players are encouraged to act according to an individualistic or competitive SVO normally result in zero-sum victo-ries, where there is only one clear winner (fennewald & Kievit-Kylar, 2013)."}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 2, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "Methods"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 2, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "as previously stated, the purpose of this study is to examine how four commercially available environment-themed board games can be used to generate environmental awareness. the project follows a qualitative research design following the framework of thematic analysis proposed by Braun and Clarke (2006).

Due to its long-standing popularity, Catan has become the subject of several fan-made expansions, one of which is the OIL SpRInGS SCEnaRIO (assadourian & Hansen, 2011) where oil is introduced as an additional resource and game mechanic. Oil can make the players' settlements grow faster and speed up their path to victory but can also cause environmental damage and climate devastation if abused - resulting in all players losing the game (Boardgamegeek.com, 2019b; Chappin et al., 2017; Lee, 2017). the OIL SpRInGS SCEnaRIO revolves around a mechanic where the players who choose to utilize oil are more likely to achieve victory than players who refrain from using it (Lee, 2017), simultaneously risking the livelihood of the whole island. as the game revolves around the use of oil as a powerful resource, we feel that it illus-trates and simulates a relatively realistic scenario in which the players need to balance their own personal and financial interests versus the interests of the player group as a whole. It is left to the players to decide if they wish to emphasize saving the island of Catan, or if a personal victory is more important (Chappin et al., 2017)."}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 2, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "Game 2 - evoluTion: CliMATe"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 2, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "EVOLutIOn (Crapuchettes, 2014) is a game where the players are set to adapt and evolve their own species in a changing ecosystem, taking on roles as carnivores and herbivores as well as developing new biological traits such as horns or hard shells to survive (Boardgamegeek.com, 2019c). the expansion pack, EVOLutIOn: CLIMatE (Crapuchettes, 2016), introduces a climate component where the temperature in the game world can swing between extreme cold and extreme heat, which results in the deaths of species that are not adapted to survive in the current climate (Boardgamegeek. com, 2019d)."}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 2, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "Game 3 - GloBAl WARMinG"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 2, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "GLOBaL WaRMInG (Bucak, 2011) is an educational card-based strategy game where the players score \"happiness points\" by providing a variety of goods to the public, which in turn influence the earth's ecology (Boardgamegeek.com, 2019e).

Being able to visualize and experience environmental issues within the safe confines of the game is a unique way to immerse learners into the sub-ject of environmental literacy, and might even represent a possible solution to the problem of environmental issues being perceived as non-salient (Hansen & Machin, 2013; Kl\u00f6ckner, 2015, p. 63; tversky & Kahneman, 1973, 1974)."}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 2, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "the second important finding in our study revolved around how players perceived the visual representation of their personal impact on the game session, as well as their"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 2, "right": 0, "firstLine": 240}}}, {"TYPE": "table", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "table-row", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "table-cell", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "Fj\u00e6llingsdal and Kl\u00f6ckner"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 2, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}]}, {"TYPE": "table-cell", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "645"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 0, "right": 2, "firstLine": 0}}}]}]}]}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "varying emphasis on resource hoarding versus resource distribution. firstly, board games were indeed shown to highlight and emphasize the interactions between each individual player and their impact on the flow of the game by situating them in fic-tional worlds (foltz et al., 2019). additionally, the players did occasionally experiment with other roles, personalities and identities than the ones they normally exhibit in a real-life setting (arnaudo, 2018, p. 27) as long as the game provided an arena for it. from a researcher's perspective, environmental board games can also be utilized to illustrate how players display different SVOs (de Groot & th\u00f8gersen, 2013, p. 143; Messick & McClintock, 1968) in social dilemma situations. Some of the players in this experiment exhibited highly individualistic or competitive SVOs, whereas others tried to collaborate and contribute to the common good. Some of the players even took on an active role where their expressed goal was to experience what would happen if the environment collapsed in the game. this suggests an innate desire to experience what previous research describes as alternate future realities (Barreteau et al., 2007; Wu & Lee, 2015), while simultaneously enjoying the benefits of the relative safety of the real world (Garc\u00eda-Barros et al., 2015)."}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 2, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "Board games are also interesting in the sense that they both allow and encourage social interaction between the players in a physical, real-life setting.

In sum, however, our main findings suggest that board games can be highly effective in illustrating and visualizing the connections between a player's actions and their impact on the game board. they can also be utilized by researchers to explore how players interact, compete and distribute or hoard resources in a social dilemma situa-tion. they also hold some promise as an answer to the call for more relatable, under-standable, concrete and simplified forms of communication about the environment and the social issues that environmental decline might cause."}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 2, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "limitations and Future Research"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 2, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "While our study reveals some promising dawning indications for the effectiveness of board games in promoting environmental awareness, there are some limitations to the study that need to be addressed. firstly, due to the qualitative nature of the study, larger-scale triangulated and quantitative studies are required in order to get a more complete picture as to the extent of the effectiveness of environment-themed board game play. Secondly, board games can be very complex and difficult to get into. this means that the players often spend a significant amount of time discussing and explain-ing the rules, supposing that they are all unfamiliar with the games chosen for the game session. In our study, players using 20-30 minutes of the time schedule to under-stand the rules was not uncommon, and one group even cancelled their gameplay due to the rules being too complex. a lacking understanding of the rules also caused sev-eral of our respondents to call the lead researcher for help during gameplay, which also added to the length of the gameplay session. future researchers are therefore encour-aged to either use a moderator or instructor with previous knowledge of the game to explain the rules before gameplay is initiated, sending the rules out to the players before the gameplay sessions begin, or including a set amount of time in the play ses-sion for the players to discuss and explain the rules of the game. thirdly, our study did not prioritize post-game debriefing sessions due to taking place late in the evening.

This phenomenon, called the cocktail party effect is a result of words that are important to oneself having a lower threshold, resulting in less attention being necessary to process them (Treisman, 1960). The current studies examined the ability of a person who was engaged in an attention demanding task to hear and recall low-threshold words from a fictional story. These low-threshold words included a traditional alert word, -fire\u2016 and fictional character names from a popular franchise-Harry Potter. Further, the role of stimulus "}, {"TYPE": "Break"}, {"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "degradation was examined by including synthetic and accented speech in the task to determine how it would impact attention and performance."}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 0, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "In Study 1 participants repeated passages from a novel that was largely unfamiliar to them, The Secret Garden while blocking out a passage from a much more familiar source, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Each unattended Harry Potter passage was edited so that it would include 4 names from the series, and the word -fire\u2016 twice. The type of speech present in the attended and unattended ears (Natural or Synthetic) was varied to examine the impact that processing a degraded speech would have on performance. The speech that the participant shadowed did not impact unattended recall, however it did impact shadowing accuracy. The speech type that was present in the unattended ear did impact the ability to recall low-threshold, Harry Potter information. When the unattended speech type was synthetic, significantly less Harry Potter information was recalled.

An accent which was different than the native accent of the participants was included as a mild form of degradation. There were four "}, {"TYPE": "Break"}, {"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "experimental stimuli which contained one of the following in the unattended ear: American Natural, British Natural, American Synthetic and British Synthetic. Overall, more unattended information was reported when the unattended channel was Natural than Synthetic. This implies that synthetic speech does take more working memory processing power than even an accented natural speech. Further, it was found that experience with the Harry Potter franchise played a role in the ability to report unattended Harry Potter information. Those who had high levels of Harry Potter experience, particularly with audiobooks, were able to process and report Harry Potter information from the unattended stimulus when it was British Natural. While, those with low Harry Potter experience were not able to report unattended Harry Potter information from this slightly degraded stimulus. Therefore, it is believed that the previous audiobook experience of those in the high Harry Potter experience group acted as training and resulted in less working memory being necessary to encode the unattended Harry Potter information."}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 0, "right": 0, "firstLine": 722}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "A pilot study was designed in order to examine the impact of story familiarity in the attended and unattended channels of a dichotic listening task.

Later, Treisman proposed that information may not be blocked out, but rather attenuated or tuned down in volume (Treisman, 1960). Deutsch and Deutsch (1963) proposed a theory that all information was processed, but that a person would become aware of only the information that was given higher weighting of importance.  Due to this interest in discerning whether or not information is processed to any degree when it is unattended, the dichotic listening task was developed by Cherry (1953). Cherry investigated attention in two different ways: using mixed speech and unmixed speech. In his mixed speech task, participants listened to two speeches that were recorded simultaneously, and the dual voices were played in both of the participant's ears. The participant's task was to separate the two audio messages, and then repeat the one of interest. Cherry found that participants were generally not very good at this task. To further investigate how the processing of language occurs, he created what we now call the dichotic listening task.

They were able to recall simple things like the fact that there was speech in the unattended ear, but could not even identify the language of the speech. The participants did not report noticing changes in speaker's language, speaker's topic, or if the speech was played backward. Cherry found that participants could tell if the gender of the speaker changed, and if the audio changed to a tone, but could not recall or identify details that were present in the unattended ear.  The conclusion that Cherry reached was that while some very minor details of the unattended ear are processed (e.g. pitch), no semantic information is processed.

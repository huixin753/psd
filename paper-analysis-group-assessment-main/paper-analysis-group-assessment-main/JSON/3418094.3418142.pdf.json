During the virus's incubation period, the patients cannot feel any symptoms caused by the virus. Thus the doctors cannot find the patients as fast as possible to limit the spread of the virus. The incubation period of the virus is also relatively long, causing the patients exponentially infecting people surrounded by them when they go to work or join parties. Asymptomatic infection may also become a source of transmission of the virus, which means that some patients, due to their special body traits, do not show obvious clinical symptoms due to their weak immune system stress response or their own physical characteristics, but they carry the virus and can infect others and cause other people having the symptoms that they don't have [23]. Asymptomatic infection is not easy to find, because they don't show any traits that can warn them to do a diagnosed test. The patients themselves do not know. Because of this, it is difficult to control and isolate in time, causing large-scale transmission, which also brings up the importance of social-distancing, section prevention and control work [24]. Thus the government has to implement coronavirus testing for everybody to diagnose those asymptomatic patients to erase the risks of further transmission.

As a high school student, I am very disappointed with the idea of herd immunity following the old trend of social Darwinism, the indifference of the government in the herds and I hope people can find a way altogether solving the pandemic issue. Scientists already experienced the previous two pandemics and accumulated a lot of relative information about the control and cure of the pandemic.

However, every NREN is opaque to CMS, as they are to every other domain science they serve, resulting in highly variable performance-unpredictably oscillating between excellent and poor. This kind of variable network performance already poses a chal-lenge for operators coordinating petascale production transfers, but a looming exascale era-meaning more and possibly larger pro-duction transfers-makes a solution all the more imperative [1, 8]. If CMS were able to instead guarantee a large fraction of available bandwidth for high-priority production transfers, they could be achieved on a predictable timescale. Meanwhile, users could share just a small portion of the remaining bandwidth without much per-formance loss. This exactly could be achieved by software-defined networking. Moreover, CMS is currently unable to easily distin-guish site issues from network issues, so when data movement is slowed, the underlying problem cannot be quickly addressed. If, however, CMS had an account of what was promised from the network, that account could be compared to the site diagnostics it already maintains in order to immediately identify the culprit. In other words, SDN bandwidth allocations can be thought of as exact\"promises\" made by the network that it is then held accountable for maintaining. Therefore, a realized SDN product would provide predictable and accountable network services, both of which CMS currently lacks and could greatly benefit from in the HL-LHC era.

Connecting deeply with stories can be a therapeutic intervention, known as creative bibliotherapy (Heath et al., 2005). Reading fiction that emotionally transports us into a story is pleasurable and rewarding, and certain fictional stories appear to pro-vide an opportunity to engage safely with our emotional difficulties while the characters we connect with engage with their own (Oatley, 1995). Due to the way that our brains process and comprehend narra-tives, it is proposed that fiction improves our ability to understand other people's perspectives (Altmann et al., 2014), and in sharing the expe-rience with others in the real world, it allows us to form connections and community, the building blocks of mental health recovery (Leamy et al., 2011).

(2011) developed a model that provides a clear framework to guide recovery-oriented services and clinical practice, and as such is frequently used (Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council, 2013). The model characterises recovery as an active, iterative, and individual process, with five central categories: connectedness - with peers, the community, and support groups; hope and optimism about the future and the possibility of recovery; identity, including rebuilding or rede-fining a positive sense of identity; meaning and quality in life; and empowerment, encompassing personal responsibility and control over one's own life (CHIME) (Leamy et al., 2011).

Reading and engaging with fictional stories in therapeutic contexts is intended to be a dynamic, interactive process, prompting real emotional responses (E\u02d8geci & Gen\u00e7\u00a8oz, 2017). Through poems, short stories, novels, and audio-visual media, creative bibliotherapy can be used as a mechanism through which clients make meaning from life experiences, draw upon fictional characters to expand their own worldview and assimilate new knowl-edge (Ellis et al., 2019). Unguided bibliotherapy, with minimal or no professional involvement, has been flagged as a cost-effective and pragmatic intervention (Wang et al., 2020), and there continues to be research demonstrating the therapeutic power of fiction outside of structured clinical contexts, where engaging with stories seems to result in almost incidental improvements in psychological wellbeing (Holman et al., 2019; Levitt et al.; 2009; Pettersson, 2018; Troscianko, 2018).

K. Rowling (1997), has inspired considerable analysis and research across many disciplines, including psychology. According to Thunnissen (2010), the novels essentially deal with the material of psychotherapy that is crucial to human growth and development, interwoven in a compelling fairy tale. The novels, while firmly rooted in the fantasy tradition, encompass many genres at different points, and delve into numerous social and psychological issues, including conflict, trauma, and identity (Vezzali et al., 2015). Rustin and Rustin (2005) also consider the novels to be brimming with psychologically rich material, as Harry Potter faces universal human anxieties such as death and abandonment, and fulfils his dream to find his \"true\" place in the world. Rosegrant posits that the devotion the series commands in fans can only have resulted from the way it broaches deep psychological issues (2009). The monumental success of the Harry Potter novels demonstrates that readers from vastly different cultural backgrounds have felt a strong, positive parasocial relationship with the protagonist, which may have grown with each novel and additional media entry point to this fictional world (Schmid & Klimmt, 2011). The series is exceptionally accessible in this regard; beyond the original seven novels, fans can interact with this fictional world through multiple films, games, appli-cations, interactive websites, theatre productions, college quidditch matches, and many other media."}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 0, "right": 0, "firstLine": 238}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "The Harry Potter series has regularly been promoted as a potential tool for mental health recovery itself. Quantitative and qualitative research has been undertaken around the Harry Potter novels to inves-tigate various elements of the text as well as to understand its success and its interaction with many different psychological variables. The series has been investigated for its depiction of resilience, attachment styles, self-harm, and childhood development (Mulholland, 2009), and explored as a potential tool to help children and adolescents cope with grief (Markell & Markell, 2013) or generate therapeutic healing in the context of narrative therapy (Oldford, 2011). Katz (2003) has consid-ered how the Dementors might be utilised to describe and understand inherited trauma, and Frank and McBee (2003) proposed that the first book in the series could be used as a starting point to discussions of identity development in gifted adolescents, in the tradition of Erikson's (1968) theory of psychosocial development. Rosegrant (2009) adds to this, describing how the latter books depict the essential developmental issues specific to later adolescence, and do so in a way that is unique in its depth, detail and complexity. The main child protagonists have been explored as potential resiliency role models in the manner that they positively cope with trauma, loss and dysfunctional family systems (Panos, 2009). On the other side of the therapy room, Gibson (2007), used the first Harry Potter novel to promote the ability to empathise in counselling students, and found that the use of the narrative in this way increased counsellor self-awareness and understanding of counselling concepts. Its genre alone may foster its therapeutic use, as Hsu et al. (2015) found through fMRI neurological research, where participants presented with passages from Harry Potter novels experienced increased activation in the amygdala and increased feelings of pleasure compared to reading passages from other genres. Given the richness of the material and the ease with which readers appear to relate to the protagonist, it is not surprising that the series has been identified by mental health cli-nicians as a recurring source of unprompted insightful discussions occurring in the therapy context, and as such, a potential source of creative bibliotherapy for individuals recovering from mental health"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 0, "right": 0, "firstLine": 238}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "3"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 52, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "K.V.

When the unique neurological processes involved in ToM and affective empathy are activated through reading fiction, we are able to be emotionally transported by stories and empathetic responses and relational in-ferences are prompted, so that we can connect deeply with characters (Bal & Veltkamp, 2013; Hsu et al., 2015; Oatley, 2016; Zunshine, 2006).

The successive releases allowed readers to grow alongside the protagonist, and the se-ries' enormous popularity permitted fan engagement and interaction on a deep level, making it evident that the series \"just gives people hope.\" Future research can build on the findings presented above by investi-gating whether more diverse fans of Harry Potter use the series in similar ways."}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 0, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "Funding"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 0, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "TabChar"}, {"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors."}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 0, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "Author note"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 0, "right": 0, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "The authors acknowledge the support of the Australian College of Applied Psychology in the preparation and writing of this manuscript.

The main character of Rowling's stories, Harry Potter, is a student at Hogwarts: School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. His adventures gained great popularity and were adapted for the screen resulting in an even larger audience. Gwilym and colleagues measured the impact of these works on the child and young adult population by following emergency room visits for musculoskeletal injuries in the U.K. during the final weeks of summer. Surprisingly, it was found that there was a decrease in emergency room visits during the weeks of the books' release. The author began the article with this provocation: \"about the children of this millennium, we can be sure of two things: they will hurt themselves, and they (probably) will read Harry Potter\".8 The popularity of Harry Potter's story invites investigation, and much has been studied, discussed and written about the works. On Medline, a trusted database for scientific articles on health, a search conducted in April 2013 with the keyword \"Harry Potter\" returned 39 articles of various medical specialties. On the same day, the same search on Google Scholar returned 35,400 results. Academic theses have been written not only in the areas of Liberal Arts, Communications, and Education, but also in Psychology, including Psychoanalysis and Analytical Psychology. The original works include more than 4100 pages of the,1-7 and almost 20hours of movies.9-16 Facing this huge cultural production and the associated scientific production, we do not assume to explore all of the aspects of this saga. The films were considered together with the books, because their images are inevitably present throughout the works, inseparable from the books. Using the reference of analytical psychology, a symbolic analysis was done of both the literary and cinematic works. The study was delimited by the following traumatic axis: Resilience and Tutors of Resilience. We propose that the \"boy who lived\"4 may symbolize the hurt child and the adolescent who meets tutors of resilience who allow for a progressive and healthy development. The works describe seven consecutive years of this hero's life, and begins with the invitation to attend such a school. The epilogue of the saga describes our protagonist's healthy family, which suggests that Harry's development had a good outcome.

Infante18 explains that postulating resilience without reducing it to invulnerability implies the assumption that the individual is affected by adversity, but is capable of overcoming. Ralha-Sim\u00f5es19 questions if it is possible to discuss resilience as the physical and psychological survival of a person against risk factors, or the individual who not only overcomes adversities but also feels happy and at peace with his existence. Facing adversities include, necessarily, being affected by them (the opposite care) or they would not be considered true adversities, or the situation of repression in the shadow. Resilience lives in the capacity to, once impacted by adversity, suffer transformations, which, during the process of individualization, result in growth rather than deformity.20 Iraci Gali\u00e1s, at a post-graduate class given at PUC in 2009, asserted that resilience should be considered a potential in the process of individualization. Ceres Ara\u00fajo explains that, according to Gali\u00e1s, following the Jungian approach, it is understood that the potential remedy of the self may be achieved by the constellation of the archetype of the Hero and by the constellation of the archetype of the Divine Child. Or, in the dynamics of resilience, the strength of heroes acting to cope, activated by overcoming as well as the bond with life and the search for something new, are necessary, which are carried by the Eternal Child.21 Some heroic images do not accurately conform to the concept of resiliency. Liliana Wahba22 proposes three profiles of heroes: the hero of reason, the hero of the mission, and the hero of complexity. The hero of reason is the hero of duty. The second type of hero is the missionary, sacrificial hero. While in the first type, evil is external, in the second type, through sacrifice, evil is incorporated and redeemed. Thus, he is equally immutable in his goals. The first two models face adversity without letting it affect them, and consequently, transform them, not representing resilience. In the third model, the hero of complexity, he suffers and is affected by adversity. In this case, there exists a transformative tragic element. The hero of complexity is also gifted with special attributes, but is wounded, suffers adversity, and faces risk; this has a transformative effect. Infante18 separates the study of resilience in two moments. The first generation of researchers of resilience investigated personal characteristics and after, familiars and environments of resilient individuals.

The author organizes the factors of resilience in this triad model and incorporates as an essential element the dynamic interaction of these factors. Melillo et al.,24 stress another element: the individual's interaction with others. Resilience would not be an innate, absolute attribute, but the result of the interaction of the individual with his environment. The authors also detach two other crucial factors: that resilience is a function of social and interpsyche processes, and that it depends on certain qualities of interactions of the individual with others. The evolution of the main character along Rowling's saga seems to follow the path of the construction of the concept of resilience presented to this point, from the initial idea of invulnerability to the dynamic concept. The first chapter of the first book is titled \"The Boy who Lived\",1 In this way, the first emphasis, personal and non-transferable, is given to Harry's capacity to survive. Still in the beginning of this book, alongside the description of abuse, a series of characteristics of resilience and analogies of this archetypal image are presented. One example is the way Harry's hair insists on staying the same way and length independent of what is done to it, without Harry having any conscious control over it. Harry has gifts of magic, similar to divine attributes of a hero, beyond his control a way to defend himself, creating unexplainable situations. The Dursleys, the family who raised Harry, have a true detestation of unexplainable facts or any allusion to magic. Our hero learned to avoid the topic, however without denying his gifts internally. He developed a persona of an obedient and submissive boy, while keeping alive his imaginative capacity and fighting for survival far from the eyes of his tormentors. In spite of the adverse conditions of this development, Harry maintained the capacity for empathy, along with indignation and rebellion. Sometimes, this internal turmoil breaks Harry's well-behaved persona, as shown in the passage of the trip to the zoo on Harry's cousin's Dudley's birthday. After one day of threats and provocations, Harry consoles himself with empathic contact with an anaconda in a tank. This moment is broken by another attack by his cousin. Harry, without knowing how, magically lets the snake go and traps Dudley in the tank. This is a passage showing Harry's lack of control, after all the capacity to control impulses is also a resilient quality.

Harry succumbs to the pressure and begins to hear voices. The partnership of his companions Hermione and Ron, and Hagrid's reception, the groundskeeper, are essential to the restitution of Harry's balance. At the climax of suspense and adventure, Ginny, then only the younger sister of Ron, Harry's best friend, falls prey to the villain and runs great risk. It is the friendship and companionship of Ron that moves Harry to his second heroic journey. His ability to speak Parseltongue allows him to enter the Chamber of Secrets, the descent to hell, and consequently confronts the shadow/villain. It is the reaffirmation of faith and loyalty to Professor Dumbledore that brings definite help, the phoenix Fawkes carrying the sword of Gryffindor inside the Sorting Hat, combining the \"I am\" smart, fearless, and loyal, and the \"I can\" fly and duel well, and the \"I have\" someone to count on.

Harry's sensibility to sense danger, arising from his injury as a child, at first is unadapted and generate mental symptoms. In a second moment, once stronger, this sense becomes the weapon with which Harry can enter in the Chamber of Secrets, in the basement of the castle, and rescues the youth from the villain's grasp, saving her life. This rescue would not be possible without external help. The phoenix, a bird that has the symbol of rebirth belongs to Headmaster Dumbledore.

Despite the tough appearance, Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor house, the house were Harry lives, bends the rules of the school during the protagonists' first week of classes when, instead of punishing Harry for an infraction, she notices his special talent to fly on broomstick and nominates him to join the house team. Thus, she bends the rules for first year students to participant in Quidditch games. With this act, the professor values and creates the opportunity for development of Harry's talent, and establishes an affective bond that becomes very important for the boy who had a premature and traumatic break of primary relationships. This bond does not impede her to give a very severe punishment to Harry and his friends when she realizes that they began to put themselves above the rules of the school, demonstrating the recognition and disapproval of the students' inflated egos. McGonagall doesn't undergo the confusion of roles brought on by this growing bond. When Harry asks her to sign an authorization in place of his uncle and aunt, as if they even went through the trouble to read it, she reminds him that only his parents or guardians can sign the form. Both the professor and the student feel the weight of the situation, but these limits preserve the bond. So, McGonagall maintains emotional and firm, expressing the equilibrium between the patriarchal and matriarchal dynamics. The emotion and the balance between the patriarchal and matriarchal dynamic of the professor help Harry and his friends in the development of otherness. Another significant example is the meeting between Harry and Professor Lupin, who teaches him the Patronus spell. To conjure the Expecto Patronum, the wizard needs to concentrate on his happiest memory; the strength of this memory will give him the strength of protection. Such a spell has a special use to banish dementors, beings that have the ability to excise all present joy, and whose presence intensely cools the environment - what an analogy for depression! These creatures bring the saddest memories to light for those being affected. The visual effect of a Patronus is a translucent, ethereal animal, which aside from banishing dementors, can also be used in moments of great need to carry messages or even objects instantaneously, as is observed in the final books of the saga. Every wizard who is able to conjure this spell conjures a specific animal, which can change, depending on emotional circumstances, emphasizing the personal, subjective and emotional character of the spell. Learning the Patronus is especially controversial. Altogether, it cannot be assumed that students are capable of learning it. Due to his exceptional susceptibility to the dementors, Harry seeks Professor Lupin who seems readily available to teach him the protective spell in a series of private lessons. Thanks to the positive transference relationships, our hero becomes the youngest wizard to learn to conjure the Expecto Patronum.

Under the rule of Dumbledore, the predominance of human relationships guided by emotion and respect for diversity, composing a healthy school environment, contributes to the psychic stability of the wizard.26 When the situation changes, the fragile balance of our hero vanishes, with plenty of elements coming to the environment and to his own history. He is better organized emotionally, not hearing voices anymore, but succumbing to the depressive and anxious symptoms, including agitated sleep and vivid nightmares. The intervention of other tutors of resilience, the members of the Order of the Phoenix, found outside of school, but through it, help him save his sanity. Among these, Harry's relationship with his godfather Sirius Black deserves to be featured. An especially emblematic dialogue occurs in the fifth film of the series. This story recounts the growth of the shadow of power at Hogwarts: School of Witchcraft and Wizardry under the intervention of the Ministry of Magic, which dismissed Dumbledore and imposed a dictatorial regime. Gerhold27 explains that everything that brought Harry that feeling of being home at Hogwarts was taken away, without the prospect of return. At Christmas, the recently restructured Order of the Phoenix, the resistance group against Voldemort, is reunited at Sirius Black's home. In a private conversation, Harry tells Sirius that he is afraid of becoming a bad person, because he feels an incommensurate amount of anger growing within him. Sirius responds lovingly that Harry is a good person, to whom very bad things have happened. The increasing consciousness of shadow scares Harry. His godfather's welcome in relation to these aspects appeases Harry, helping him to become stronger. Our hero presents an early reflective conscious and recognizes the presence of the shadow. In this passage we see an important characteristic in the dynamic of resilience: the capacity to confront dark aspects, here welcomed lovingly by a tutor of resilience. This capacity, essential in the journey towards individualization, would also serve as a proactive factor in regards to the shadow within the healthy development in adverse situations. However, without the due reception, this same characteristic would serve to deepen depressive symptoms. This was not the only time where Harry depended on the precious support of his godfather. They met at the end of the third book when, after undoing messes, Sirius asserts the symbolic adoption of Harry. For the next two years, until the death of Black, Harry corresponds with his godfather with the intensity that the underground situation permits. It is Black who Harry calls on when he feels frightened by premonitory nightmares of Voldemort, or on occasion of the Tri-Wizard Tournament. It is also Sirius who Harry reports to when he discovers the dark aspects of his father. His godfather is always welcoming, however he does not gloss over reality. Harry suffers tremendously with the death of his godfather, this time welcomed by Headmaster Dumbledore, director of Hogwarts, who remains tolerant and loving with Harry's intense anger in his office.

Hermione is tortured, reinforcing the image of intolerance associated with the tides of evil. Dolby, a house elf freed by Harry in the second book, helps the trio escape, at the cost of his own life. Although elves constitute a species of magical beings highly subjugated by wizards, only they have the power to escape from the fortress where the protagonists were trapped, a fact that does not go unnoticed by our hero.

Between the three and the four there exists the primary opposition of male and female, but whereas fourness is a symbol of wholeness, threeness is not. The later, according to alchemy, denotes polarity, since one triad always presupposes another, just as high presupposes low, lightness darkness, good evil. ... If one imagines the quaternity as a square divided into two halves by a diagonal, one gets two triangles whose apices point in opposite directions. One could therefore say metaphorically that if the wholeness symbolized by the quaternity is divided into equal halves, it produces two opposing triads.28 Through the suffering of his loved ones, Harry is able to control the shadow's possession, giving up the mandala of power and glimpsing the search for transcendence from the narcissistic wound. The way would be the restitution of mortality to the shattered soul of the villain, the destruction of what trapped the fragments of his soul to Earth. With reinvigorated harmony, the trio, recognizing mutually each other's talents, resumes the search initiated by their professor in the beginning of the sixth book. Dash29 associates the fact that the principal villain parted his soul in seven pieces forming the Horcruxes to the problem of the fragmented development of the modern man. Voldemort would never understand the power of a unified soul, which he gave up during his search to overcome death. He searched for immortality while perpetrating violence against others and against himself, without ever realizing the importance of the connection with totality, and of the disconnection that violence brings. Like the villain/shadow, Harry has the potential for aggression, which at the beginning of the saga appears dissociated from his conscious, like an autonomous complex, for example, when Dobby the elf throw Tia Petunia's cake on the floor in the middle of a dinner at Harry's family's home while Harry, even though it was his birthday, had to remain locked in his room. The destructive force emerges when he has to defend himself against his cousin, sometimes counter-attacking frighteningly, to the point of leaving his cousin in a state of emotional shock in the beginning of the fifth book, or when he inflates his aunt like a balloon, or still when he breaks his professor's belongings. This aggression continues to gradually transform and become integrated into his conscience through the welcoming of his tutors of resilience and the fraternal welcome of his friends. He directs and structures his physical identity through sports and competitive games, and begins taking shape thanks to the creative limits of Hogwarts. The importance of transformation and direction, without emasculation, is the difference between sacrifice and mutilation.28-30 If the latter can paralyze or deform development, the former permits the direction of aggressive energy in a creative way, promoting the rupture of the old for the emergence of the new. The search for the Horcruxes is a revisit to the history of the villain/shadow, still called Tom Riddle, since his time at the orphanage, his time at Hogwarts, and until the height of his fame. Two of the artifacts mark the beginning of this history: his wizard grandfather's ring, an alliance with his noble wizard ancestry, over his father's Muggle ancestry; and his diary as a student, a record of his time at Hogwarts, which like the protagonists, would also signify a place of belonging, excluding when his request to join the faculty was denied by Dumbledore, who realized his excessive ambition. Three artifacts belonged to three founders of Hogwarts: the locket of Salazar Slytherin, another homage to his noble wizard ancestry; the cup of Helga Hufflepuff, an object of the founder of the house of unlimited emotion and welcoming that, similar to the Holy Grail for those who sought it, lost its original significance of otherness and in turn mistakenly symbolized patriarchal power; and the diadem"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 120, "right": 98, "firstLine": 0}}}, {"TYPE": "paragraph", "VALUE": [{"TYPE": "text", "VALUE": "of Rowena Ravenclaw, a female adornment which brought wisdom to whomever wore it, which had an equally distorted patriarchal significance, understood as an ostentatious object, distancing itself from chthonic wisdom.

The shadow of recognition of only one part of human ancestry, making immortal the alliance with classic, noble, intellectual ancestry and forgetting the tribal origin, matriarchal and emotional, brings the chthonic wisdom.

Of the three Deathly Hallows, Harry leaves the Resurrection Stone on the ground of the Forbidden Forest, buries the Elder Wand in Dumbledore's tomb, and keeps for himself the Invisibility Cloak, the only of the three with the exclusive purpose of defense. The great defense of the cloak is to disappear from sight of others, the opposite of the fame of glory. Thanks to the cloak, Ignoto Peverell was the only of the three brothers, creators and carriers of the Deathly Hallows, to have a long life and natural death. He lived his whole life anonymously, in the village of Godric's Hollow, which materializes the utopia of wizards and Muggles living harmoniously. It is not much more than a small unimportant and unknown village in England, where Harry was born and his parents lived. It is the antithesis of ego inflation, strengthened further socially in the environment, and that Harry overcomes when leaving adolescence and integrating his adult identity. Before burying the Elder Wand, the wizard reconstructs his own wand, which chose him when he was 11years old. He feels better with this wand. With the origin reintegrated, he can finally reunite romantically with Ginny. With the entrance of feminine power of the specialist in boogeymen, the expert in seeing fear as ridiculous, the trio of protagonists becomes a group of four. Harry Potter, the boy who lived, son of Lily and James Potter who died to lovingly save Harry's life, marries Ginny, member of a traditional wizard family who dared to deny the solution of endogamy as a defense, and whose greatest power is humor and emotion. Nineteen years later, the couple makes an indication of the possibility of the conscious union of two opposites by giving their son the name Albus Severus Potter. This union of the names of Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape are the greatest representations of Gryffindor and Slytherin, respectively. These houses, which represent the polarity between inclusive diversity and exclusive homogeneity throughout the saga, are united and revealed by our hero's son. The symbol of the divine child brings a new forthcoming that point to the possibility of integration of these polarities and the hope the war for"}], "style": {"indent": {"TYPE": "CT_Ind", "left": 96,
